    # Throughput hinting is designed to save power by slowing down the gpu
    # if it is beating the desired frame.  Without hinting, the gpu frequency
    # scaler operates just by watching the load.
    # When enabled, throughput hinting is only used if there is only one "app"
    # running, which is counted by the number of egl contexts that are
    # bound to window surfaces.  However, the current implementation flipflops
    # the app count when an app is animating content on two window surfaces
    # simulataneously.  This amounts to many alternating calls to eglMakeCurrent
    # on one context and two different surfaces.  When the app count flip flops
    # we get inconsistent provision of hints, and this prevents the gpu frequency
    # from scaling up as it should.
    # Until this is fixed, throughput hinting is universally disabled here.
    # Note that most of the time on Molly the hinting was unused anyway
    # since the live wallpaper keeps its context alive even while
    # invisible so the app count is always >= 2.
    # In order to use the hinting we'll need to have the wallpaper tear down
    # down its context appropriately.
